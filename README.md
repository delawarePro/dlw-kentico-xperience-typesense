# Xperience by Kentico Typesense integration by delaware consulting

## Description

This integration enables you to create [Typesense](https://typesense.org/) search collections to collection content of pages ([content types](https://docs.xperience.io/x/gYHWCQ) with the 'Page' feature enabled) from the Xperience content tree using a code-first approach. To provide a search interface for the collectioned content, developers can use the [.NET API](https://github.com/DAXGRID/typesense-dotnet), [JavaScript API](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-js), or the [InstantSearch.js](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/search-ui-components.html) library.

**Be aware that this integration has been developed by delaware consulting and is not an official Kentico product.**

Add the package to your application using the .NET CLI

dotnet add package Kentico.Xperience.Typesense
```

## Quick Start

1. Add configuration from your Typesense account to the ASP.NET Core `appsettings.json` file:

   ```json
    "CMSTypesenseSearch": {
    "ApiKey": "<your collectioning API key>",
    "Node": {
      "Host": "<your typesense host (localhost)>",
      "Port": <your typesense port (8108)>,
      "Protocol": "<your typesense protocol (http)>"
    }
   },

2. Define a custom `DefaultTypesenseCollectionStrategy` implementation to customize how content pages/content items are processed for the collection. See [`Custom-collection-strategy.md`](docs/Custom-collection-strategy.md)
3. Add this library to the application services, registering your custom `DefaultTypesenseCollectionStrategy` and Typesense services

   ```csharp
   // Program.cs
   services.AddKenticoTypesense(configuration);
   services.RegisterStrategy<GlobalTypesenseCollectionStrategy>("DefaultStrategy");
   ```

4. Create an collection in Xperience's Administration within the Search application added by this library.
